## Project 1

Create a simple, functional website of your choice.

This is an opportunity to apply what we've learned while exploring your own interests.

Your website can be a portfolio website, a landing page for a business, a personal blog, an e-commerce/storefront, etc. Whatever you want.

The following requirements should help give you some structure.

- Your website should have at least 3 pages, each with a consistent `<header>` and `<footer>`.
- Include working navigation links to navigate between pages.
- Use semantic HTML elements for document structure (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.).
- All elements should be styled with CSS. Do not leave any default HTML styling.
- Use a single external stylesheet for all of the pages.
- Include element, class, and ID selectors in your CSS.
- Include at least one image on your site.
- Use at least one instance of `margin`, `padding`, `display`, and `position` in your CSS. Be prepared to explain your choices.

These requirements are just a starting point. Meeting these requirements alone will not get you 100%. I want you to go above and beyond, impress me with your HTML and CSS skills. Be creative and have fun with this project! Don't be afraid to try new things (maybe stay away from Flexbox and Grid for now though).

In your `README.md`, include a brief description of your project and what you learned while building it. I would love to hear about your initial ideas, problems you ran into, and how your project evolved. Give descriptions for design and layout decisions that you made.
