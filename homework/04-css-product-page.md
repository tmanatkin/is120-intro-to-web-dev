# CSS Product Page

Revisit your HTML product page and add some CSS to make it look a little nicer.

I'll give you freedom as to what you would like to do with the revised product page, but ask that you follow these requirements.

- Create a new GitHub repo named `is120-hw4-firstname-lastname`
- Use an embedded Google Font in the assignment
- Use an external `style.css`
- Use each of the following CSS properties in a meaningful way in the assignment
  - `color` `background-color` `opacity` `width` `height` `font-family` `font-size` `font-weight` `font-style` `text-align` `line-height` `text-decoration` `border` `border-radius`
  - I would recommend using W3 Schools for learning how to use `border` and `border-radius`

- Find 3 additional CSS properties that we didn't cover in class to use in the assignment
  > Note: I would stay away from complex layout properties like `margin`, `padding`, `display`, `position`, `float`, `flex`, `grid`, etc. We will cover these later in class.

Include a single comment at the top of your `index.html` explaining the 3 additional properties you found and how you used them.

Submit the URL to your repo in LearningSuite.
