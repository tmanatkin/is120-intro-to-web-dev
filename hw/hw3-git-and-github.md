Create and publish a GitHub repo. Make sure it's public. Name it `is120-hw-github-firstname-lastname`

In 3 separate commits, add the following to your repo. Be descriptive in your commit messages.

1. Add a `.gitignore`

- Create a new file called `secret.html`. You can put your deepest darkest secrets in here.
- Create a new directory called `junk`. Add any random junk files you want to in here.
- Add rules to your `.gitignore` to ignore `secret.html` and the entire `junk` directory.

  > Note: Watch your source control as you edit your `.gitignore` to make sure you don't commit anything you don't want

2. Add a `index.html`
   - Just include some generic HTML content here, whatever you want.

3. Add a `README.md`
   - Brief description of the repo.
   - Include your first and last name.
