Create and publish a GitHub repo. Make sure it's public. Name it `is120-hw-github-firstname-lastname`

In 3 separate commits, add the following to your repo. Be descriptive in your commit messages.

1. Add a `.gitignore`

- Create a new file called `secret.html`. You can put your deepest darkest secrets in here.
- Create a new directory called `junk`. Add any random junk files you want to in here.
- Add rules to your `.gitignore` to ignore `secret.html` and the entire `junk` directory.

  > Note: Watch your source control as you edit your `.gitignore` to make sure you don't commit anything you don't want

2. Add a `index.html`
   - Just include some generic HTML content here, whatever you want.

3. Add a `README.md`
   - Brief description of the repo.
   - Include your first and last name.

After your initial commits are completed, publish the website using GitHub Pages.
Make sure to add the link to the live website under the About section of your GitHub repo.

On LearningSuite, turn in the link to your repo. Don't use the Git URL or GitHub Pages link.

- Example `https://github.com/username/repo`

- This is a Git URL `https://github.com/username/repo.git`

- This is GitHub Pages `https://username.github.io/repo`
