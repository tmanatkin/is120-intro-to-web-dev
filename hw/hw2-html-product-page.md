Make a single HTML file for a product information page. Content is up to you. The goal of this assignment is for you to learn how to structure a page and choose the appropriate semantic HTML elements. For now, avoid using tags like div or span unless no semantic alternative makes sense.

Your page should include the following:

- Product name
- Short product tagline
- Product description
- Product image (include alternate text for accessibility purposes). Please use a link to an image instead of a local file. Picsum is a great source for this https://picsum.photos
- List of key features
- Table with various technical specifications (e.g., weight, dimensions, materials)
- List of ordered steps or instructions
- Working link to the company website (should open in a new tab)
- Support or contact info (include an email or telephone link that works)
- Add to cart button
- Give any **emphasis** or **strong** importance to text where it makes sense

As you build your page, consider grouping related content using semantic page sections like header, main, section, article, and footer. You don’t need to use all of them, just think about how they can improve the structure and accessibility of your page.

Include a single HTML comment at the top of your file explaining your choice of elements and general page structure.

Make sure your HTML validates in VS Code with no errors or warnings.

When you are ready to submit, please upload a file with the format firstname-lastname.html to LearningSuite.
